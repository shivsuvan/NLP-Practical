Thus, a cryptocurrency is a medium of exchange (like ordinary money) that exists in the digital world and uses encryption that ensures the security of transactions. Cryptocurrency is an alternative form of payment in cash and credit cards.\n\nIn simple terms, cryptocurrency is a type of digital or virtual money. It serves as ordinary money, such as dollars, pounds, euros, yen, etc. But it has no physical counterparts \u2014 banknotes or coins that can be carried around, that is, the cryptocurrency exists only in electronic form.\n\nBitcoin is the first cryptocurrency that appeared in 2009. Bitcoin is often compared to gold in the sense that its offer is limited. However, unlike gold, Bitcoin is digital, making it much easier to divide, transfer and store.\n\nBitcoin is the most popular cryptocurrency, but there are hundreds of others. Some cryptocurrencies, such as Litecoin and Bitcoin Cash, share the basic characteristics of Bitcoin, but explore new ways to process transactions, others offer a wider range of functions. For example, Ethereum can be used to launch applications and create smart contracts.",

It follows the ideas set out in a whitepaper by the mysterious and pseudonymous Satoshi Nakamoto.\n\nThe identity of the person or persons who created the technology is still a mystery. Bitcoin offers the promise of lower transaction fees than traditional online payment mechanisms and is operated by a decentralized authority, unlike government-issued currencies.\n\nThere are no physical bitcoins, only balances kept on a public ledger that everyone has transparent access to, that \u2013 along with all Bitcoin transactions \u2013 is verified by a massive amount of computing power. Bitcoins are not issued or backed by any banks or governments, nor are individual bitcoins valuable as a commodity. Despite it not being legal tender, Bitcoin charts high on popularity, and has triggered the launch of hundreds of other virtual currencies collectively referred to as Ripple. Etc.\n\nBitcoin is powered by a technology called a blockchain. To understand Bitcoin, you must understand a little bit about the technology in order to make a wise choice for your investment strategy.\n\nA blockchain is a public database that shows all transactions, with user privacy protected by \u201ccryptography\u201d.\n\nThere are many types of blockchains, and many types of coins.\n\nSince Bitcoin was created, there have been hundreds of more coins brought to the market, many of which are cheaper, faster, and more efficient.\n\nFor example, Litecoin processes at 56 transactions per second. Newer faster blockchains like EOS can process hundreds of thousands of transactions per second.\n\nIn terms of utility, Bitcoin only processes 7 transactions per second.\n\nSo you may be wondering, why is the price of Bitcoin so high?\n\nThere are lots of reasons, such as the fact that it was the first coin, it has brand recognition, and you can use to buy services on some internet websites.\n\nBut other coins like Litecoin and Bitcoin Cash are catching up.",

Doing it, people would be able to send and receive money worldwide feeless and without the friction of any intermediaries.\n\nAt first, Bitcoin solved the trust problem. Apart from the fact that people can transact money directly over the internet with no intermediaries involved, they can also participate in developing the network trying to make it more secure. Thus, Satoshi disappeared being confident that the development of the network would continue.\n\nOne of the unique features of BTC is the absence of the leader, as all changes are made through consensus among all network participants. The Bitcoin ecosystem has a large open source developer community, who contribute research, peer review, testing, documentation, and translation. Moreover, according to Electric Capital research conducted in Dec, 2020, it is expanding, having 70%+ more developers than it did 3 years ago.\n\nThough, Bitcoin has done a long way to its primary purpose.\n\nAt first, Bitcoin was traded for only a few cents and was mainly used for things like gambling.\n\nIn 2010, the first online crypto exchange Mt. Gox, was opened.\n\nLater, Silk Road (a dark web marketplace for buying and selling drugs) stated using BTC as a method of payment.\n\nWith the increase of use, BTC's price hit $1 for the first time in spring 2011. It caught the attention of early investors and speculators.\n\nNew cryptocurrencies were created to compete with BTC or solve other problems. They were called altcoins, as alternatives to Bitcoin.\n\nThough the FBI shut down the Silk Road in 2013, it showcased the promise of Bitcoin as a digital payment method.\n\nIn March 2014, Mt.Gox went bankrupt following a massive hack.\n\nDespite the closure of the Silk Road and the collapse of Mt. Gox the crypto space kept expanding.\n\nNow there are a lot of pro-crypto people and yet companies accepting Bitcoins, who believe that BTC can alter a global economy with digital money, changing it for the better.\n\n\nHow does Bitcoin work?\n\nSince Bitcoin is decentralized, volunteers who are called \"miners\" constantly verify and update the blockchain. As soon as a specific amount of transactions are verified, another block is added to the blockchain.\n\nBTC's system rewards successful miners with bitcoins. The reward changes over time, halving about every four years. The current reward for a new block of verified transactions is 6.25 BTC. By reducing the rewards of mining bitcoin, halving ensures that the amount of bitcoin in circulation does not increase exponentially, which also tends to put upward pressure on its price.\n\nThe algorithm works like this: you create a transaction =%3E it is added to the network and sent to miners =%3E they confirm it =%3E your funds have successfully been sent.\n\nIs Bitcoin Legal?\n\nBitcoin ownership and mining are legal in more countries than not. Some examples of places where it is illegal are Algeria, Egypt, Morocco, Bolivia, Ecuador, Nepal, and Pakistan.\ufeff Overall, Bitcoin use and mining are legal across much of the globe.\n\n\nHow did it appear?\n\nSince the code for Bitcoin may have been written in 2007, the first known sign of it came out in August 2008, when the domain name for \"http://bitcoin.org [ http://bitcoin.org/ ]\" was registered.\n\nBitcoin was introduced to the world by a person under the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto in October 2008 when he posted a paper  [ https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf ]titled \"Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System\" to the cryptography mailing list. The Bitcoin white paper is not only considered the most seminal piece of work in the cryptocurrency movement, it also gave birth to a transformative technology called blockchain.\n\n\ud83d\udc46 It is interesting to know that he has never intended to invent a currency. In his announcement of Bitcoin in late 2008, Satoshi said that he developed \"A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System\" only.\n\nOn 3rd Jan 2009, he mined the first block called \"Genesis\" with the text: \"The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks.\"\n\nIt refers to a headline in The Times newspaper from the same date. It's possible that Nakamoto just picked the first headline he saw in the nearest paper. However, crypto enthusiasts tend to agree it's a statement of intent. The financial crisis of 2008 was still unraveling, and it's assumed that Bitcoin was a reaction to the widespread anger and frustration at the current financial system.\n\n9th Jan 2009, Nakamoto announced Bitcoin version 0.1 in his \"White Paper\" to the cryptography mailing list.\n\n12th Jan 2009: Nakamoto does the first Bitcoin transaction to Hal Finney, who was heavily involved in the community, advocating for the use of cryptography and privacy-enhancing technologies.\n\nIn 2010, Satoshi Nakamoto officially stopped communicating. Between this period, the Bitcoins existing on the blockchain ledger, have not been used or spent. It proves how much Satoshi owns.\n\nHaving disappeared, Satoshi officially decentralized the network for good. Nakamoto created their last forum post on 12th December and continued occasionally responding to emails for a little longer, staying in touch with BTC developer Gavin Andresen until at least April.\n\nSatoshi Nakamoto last message on the Bitcoin Forum\n\nNakamoto has not been involved in any of the changes since then.\n\n\nThanks for reading my answer!

Many of those who endorse Bitcoin believe that it facilitates a much faster, low-fee payment system for transactions across the globe. Although it is not backed by any government or central bank, bitcoin can be exchanged for traditional currencies; in fact, its exchange rate against the dollar attracts potential investors and traders interested in currency plays. Indeed, one of the primary reasons for the growth of digital currencies like Bitcoin is that they can act as an alternative to national fiat money and traditional commodities like gold.\n\nBitcoins can be accepted as a means of payment for products sold or services provided. If you have a brick and mortar store, just display a sign saying \u201cBitcoin Accepted Here\u201d and many of your customers may well take you up on it; the transactions can be handled with the requisite hardware terminal or wallet address through QR codes and touch screen apps. An online business can easily accept bitcoins by just adding this payment option to the others it offers credit cards, PayPal, etc.",

The open source, P2P Bitcoin network facilitates the creation of all bitcoin and manages all bitcoin transactions.\n\nOften referred to as \u201ccash for the Internet,\u201d Bitcoin is one of several popular digital payment currencies along with Litecoin, Peercoin, and Namecoin. When the word Bitcoin is capitalized, it usually refers to the software and systems used for bitcoin (in lowercase it refers to the actual currency).\n\nBITCOIN HISTORY\n\nFirst introduced in 2009, bitcoin is considered the biggest, most widely traded cryptocurrency in use today. Bitcoin as an implementation of the cryptocurrency concept was described by Wei Dai in 1998 on the cypherpunks mailing list. Dai suggested a new form of money that uses cryptography to control its creation and transactions, rather than a traditional bank or other central authority.\n\nIn 2008, the Bitcoin specification and proof of concept was published in a cryptography mailing list by a person or group named Satoshi Nakamoto. The first bitcoin transaction took place in early 2009, effectively mining the first block. Satoshi Nakamoto supposedly left the project in late 2010 without revealing any identifying information.\n\nHOW BITCOIN WORKS\n\nInvestment in bitcoin begins by establishing a secure bitcoin \u201cwallet\u201d that stores public and private keys for bitcoin transactions. These wallets are typically a mobile application or desktop program. Some countries require specific information to verify the identity of a user trying to buy and sell bitcoin; in the United States, a user must provide a valid driver\u2019s license, Social Security Number, and other documents in compliance with anti-money laundering legislation.\n\nFrom there, a user can purchase bitcoin in a bitcoin exchange using traditional payment methods like a credit card, bank transfer, or debit card. Bitcoin can be used to pay for goods and services just like traditional currency, but it can also be exchanged for traditional currency or other cryptocurrencies like Litecoin, Ethereum, Ripple, and Stellar.\n\nTo complete a bitcoin transaction, a user must know the input key (or address) of another user\u2019s wallet typically a string of 16-35 alphanumeric characters, which creates a pseudo-anonymous environment. The Bitcoin protocol verifies that the sender has sufficient bitcoin to complete the transaction based on transaction history, and confirms the transaction. A transaction also requires a fee, which is self-offered and goes to a volunteer bitcoin miner whose computer processes the transaction. (More on miners below.) The higher the fee added to a transaction, the quicker the transaction will be processed.\n\nBITCOIN MINING\n\nAlthough bitcoins do not physically exist, they are \u201cdiscovered\u201d by volunteer coders called miners. These miners use high-performance computers to solve complex computational problems and process transactions. This process creates (or \u201cmines\u201d) single blocks, which are then added to a public record called a blockchain. Because the blockchain is publicly available, the essence of bitcoin is decentralized.\n\nRegardless of how many miners are simultaneously processing transactions, the Bitcoin protocol dictates how long it takes to mine a single bitcoin. This ensures new bitcoins are created at a fixed rate, although the cost of mining said bitcoin is a variable that leads to intense competition among bitcoin miners. It is also worth noting that the Bitcoin source code dictates that the lifetime supply of bitcoin is limited to 21 million.\n\nBITCOIN SECURITY\n\nWhile attackers target Bitcoin-related sites, there is an important distinction between the security of the Bitcoin marketplace and the Bitcoin exchanges. There have been compromises of various Bitcoin exchanges throughout the virtual currency\u2019s lifetime, and as the value of a Bitcoin increases, so does the risk in using exchanges.",

            "text": "Bitcoin is a crypto-currency or software that forms a decentralized, peer-to-peer, world-wide payment system, without the control of any centralised authority.The blockchain software resides on thousands of computers, all over the world and is maintained by a mix of ordinary people and more sophisticated computer experts, collectively known as \u2018miners\u2019. Bitcoins are transferred via a peer-to-peer network between individuals, with no middleman bank to take a slice.\n\nThe unit of account in this system is \u2018Bitcoin\u2019. A \u2018Satoshi\u2019 (named after its creator) is the smallest amount within bitcoin, representing 0.00000001 bitcoin, i.e. divisible down to 8 decimal points.\n\nThe bitcoin network runs on a software system called \u2018blockchain\u2019. The blockchain software can be used to store and send anything of value, so there are companies using it to store documents like property deeds, etc. Blockchain as a technology is becoming popular among banks and other big financial institutions, who want to use it to settle payments on their back-end systems.\n\nBitcoin can be converted into ordinary currency based on its value on that date, or even used to make purchases from sellers that accept bitcoin.\n\nThe bitcoin blockchain by itself is very secure, but the bitcoins can be stolen from an account by stealing log-on and password info, i.e. \u2018private key\u2019 of the account holder and the bitcoin can be sent to another account controlled by the thief. Once bitcoin is transferred, it can\u2019t be recovered.\n\nAt present, most investors are not really using it like a currency to make payments, but instead, are using it as a speculative investment, with the hope to turn it into profit in the future. As on date, \u2018bitcoin\u2019 has not been accepted as a legal tender in India. Japan and Australia have officially accepted bitcoin as a legal currency.\n\nBitcoin is being considered as a genuine innovation that will be around for a long time and help transform money.\n\nPositive Implications Of Rise Of This Crypto-Currency:\n\n\u2022 Governments across the world have already stepped in, to regulate trading in bitcoin, so that it can become a more established part of the financial system. Hence, it will actually legitimize the currency and broaden its adoption for investors.\n\n\u2022 Some financial experts see the recent surge in bitcoin market as a bubble that may burst. But because the bitcoin market cap is very small, even if it crashed, it would not have a significant impact on the broader financial markets.\n\n\u2022 In the recent weeks it has been seen that the global stock market rally has slowed down, but bitcoin has continued to surge higher, which is luring more and more investors to invest in this market.\n\n\u2022 Slowly bitcoin as a currency is catching on among some retailers, mostly e-commerce: US companies like, Overstock accepts bitcoin, as does Microsoft\u2019s Xbox store, and PayPal and Square allow merchants to accept bitcoin.\n\n\u2022 The retailers might even encourage customers to pay in bitcoin in future if it costs them less in transaction fees than credit cards do.\n\nNegative Implications\n\n\u2022 Sincebitcoin transfers cannot be traced, bitcoin is often used to purchase drugs or stolen goods or finance other types of criminal activity.\n\n\u2022 It can become a major source for terror funding across the globe.\n\n\u2022 It is believed that 40% of the bitcoin are owned by just 1000 people and hence, powerful people or \u2018whales\u2019 could collude to influence the price of bitcoin.\n\n\u2022 Moreover, since there are relatively few buyers and sellers of bitcoin, this market is likely to remain volatile and the \u2018whales\u2019 could easily push the price around.\n\n\u2022 There is a risk that the demand of bitcoin may go down sending its price plummeting. It can happen because of any unforeseen circumstances like, technical problem, regulatory interference, bad publicity arising from the massive amount of electrical power needed to mine for bitcoin, etc.\n\n\u2022 Bitcoin offers both anonymity and the security of an electronic transaction. Hence, bitcoin can become a sub-economy where people could hide their income and evade government taxes.\n\n\u2022 Bitcoin is not as liquid as other investments, firstly because settlement can take more than a week, and secondly, amid panic selling, some bitcoin holders might be unable to sell for a fairly long time, resulting in steep losses.\n\nConclusion\n\nBitcoin as a crypto-currency is gaining huge popularity. In fact, on 03 March 2017, the price of a bitcoin had surpassed the market value of an ounce of gold for the first time as its price surged to an all-time high of $1,268.\n\nHowever, big banks, brokers and financial institutions have warned that bitcoin currency should not be ushered in hurriedly without adequate transparency, regulatory mechanism and risk assessment.\n\nBitcoin users predict 94% of all bitcoins will have been released by 2024. As the total number creeps toward the 21 million mark, many suspect the profits miners once made creating new blocks will become so low they'll become negligible. But with more bitcoins in circulation, people also expect transaction fees to rise, possibly making up the difference.\n\nSource- Implications of Meteoric Rise of Bitcoin Crypto-Currency [ http://www.olivegreens.co.in/blog/implications-of-meteoric-rise-of-bitcoin-crypto-currency ]",

            "text": "Here\u2019s my definition broken into smaller pieces which should make it simpler to understand:\n\nBitcoin is a digital currency that is distributed/decentralized, trust-free, secure, and deflationary. It's a currency that may one day replace money as we know it.\n\nA Digital Currency\n\nBitcoin and most other alt coins (alternative to Bitcoin), are whats called cryptocurrencies. These are online currencies that unlike the dollar or gold have no physical counterpart. They are made up of bits and bytes, hence the name. As everything in our lives moves online physical cash becomes obsolete. Due to its digital nature bitcoin needs no banks and transacts fast and low cost even between individuals on opposite ends of the globe.\n\nDISTRIBUTED AND DECENTRALIZED:\n\nInformation is power. In our current centralized system, banks, insurance agencies, the government etc. hold masses of information about us. This gives these middle men more power than we want. If our records were to be changed at the source (think bank account or identity) we'd be in big trouble. Cryptocurrencies store all information on whats called a 'distributed ledger', a sort of record book that millions of computers have copies of. This means if someone tried to temper with the recordbook, there's a million computers that will spot the inconsistency, and prevent the change.\n\nSECURE & TRUST FREE:\n\nDue to its distributed nature, it's very hard and nearly impossible to hack cryptocurrencies. This is because you would not just have to hack your banks server, but at least more than half the computers in the entire system, and then do it really fast. To make it even better, every transaction is heavily encrypted (that's where the 'crypto' in crypto-currency comes from.)\n\nBecause no one can tamper with the system, you dont need to trust anyone, but the system, since the system is incorruptible.\n\nDEFLATIONARY:\n\nThe governments favorite past-time appears to be printing money. This constantly leads to currency devaluation around the globe. Many cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin however have a limited quantity that will never be increased. In fact every time someone loses their bitcoins, the total circulation of bitcoin effectively decreases.\n\nThis is where basic economics comes in. A super powerful solution everyone will eventually want (high demand), but with a low ever decreasing supply. Econ 101 tells us prices rise.\n\n\nIf you\u2019d like to learn more about crypto currency investing, how to spot highly profitable coins and avoid scammers, check out our flagship course Foundations of Crypto Trading [ http://www.cryptoacademy.us/ ] at CryptoAcademy.us [ http://cryptoacademy.us/ ].

This report focuses on bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin was made by an individual or group of individuals under the title Satoshi Nakamoto at 2009. It had been meant to be applied as a way of payment of trades fees, transfer flaws or government oversight. But customers and most companies are to embrace bitcoin and it far too volatile to offer a valid alternative to currencies.\n\nBitcoin is utilized as a kind of investment. Its attributes resemble commodities instead of traditional monies. This is as itis unaffected and's beyond the effect of one market. There are and dealers should keep in mind these.\n\nCan bitcoin work?\n\nBitcoin depends upon two mechanics to operate so as -- the mining procedure along with the blockchain.\n\nThe blockchain is. Cryptocurrency trades are grouped into'blocks' by miners. Until they get connected into the blockchain, the cubes are then secured. The blockchain is available to everyone but could be altered with the power of the vast majority of the network.\n\nWhat is exploration?\n\nMining is the process of procuring each block. After a block is procured units of cryptocurrency called'block rewards' . These components can be injected by miners straight back. Over bitcoin, miners can exert control On account of their part in this procedure.",

It's totally a free mode of transaction asset which comes in a form of certain computer codes developed by cryptographic algorithms.\n\nTalking about its birth, Bitcoins were developed around the year 2009 by the programmer or a group of programmers under the name \u201cSATOSHI NAKAMOTO\u201d but who is the real developer of the Bitcoin concept: identity is still unknown.\n\nHow does the currency work?\n\nThe Bitcoin works by cracking mathematical algorithms. Suppose you want to get Bitcoins, you can go to the miners of Bitcoins who can exchange your physical currency with the Bitcoins.\n\nThe reason why people are showing their immense interests upon Bitcoins is because of its glorious past and it's journey from their after. In 2009, one Bitcoin was around 6INR; In may 2014, it was around 30000INR and currently (beginning of 2017), one Bitcoin is equivalent to nearly 860$ which is approx. 61000INR. So, price of Bitcoin is increasing drastically, more than the price of the land or real estate. Hence people are interested in this area.\n\nInterestingly, the reason why the price is increasing drastically is because of the fact that in every four years, the production of Bitcoins are cut-down to half; which directly increase the demand by supply-demand concept (supply is inversely proportional to the demand). Hence, mind it: there is a certain year in 22nd century after which Bitcoin production will come to an end and till that time , one Bitcoin will be equivalent to crores of INR.\n\nIs it safe?\n\nYeah. 100% it's claimed to be safe. Reason is simple. It's because you can't erase the data from the internet which makes the process transparent. Secondly, there are so called \u201cBitcoin miners\u201d which have voluntary interests to keep a look upon the Bitcoin algorithms and transactions, in return of which they get some Bitcoins as their reward.\n\nI'm sure you are really excited to know more about Bitcoins after reading this. So here I'm sharing YouTube link which you can go through-\n\nExplained in English by watchmojo-\n\nhttps://youtu.be/2UC_8NdR1To\nThankyou. Enjoy the technology!!",
